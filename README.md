<img src="screenshots/main.png" alt="main" align="right" width="500px">

Inventory App is a desktop inventory management system built with [**Wails**](https://wails.io/) and Vue. It lets you manage items, warehouses, suppliers and deliveries, track stock levels with interactive charts and handle user authentication with roles. Data can be exported to **Excel** and is stored in PostgreSQL.
